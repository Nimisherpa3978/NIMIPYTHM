## Live Wallpaper: Data Scientists at Work (AI Visualization)

> **Background Description:**  
> _A futuristic digital workspace illuminated by glowing blue and violet hues. Diverse data scientists collaborate at transparent desks, immersed in holographic screens filled with flowing code, graphs, neural networks, and real-time analytics. 3D data visualizations hover in the air, AI-powered robots assist in the background, and subtle particle effects symbolize the energy of innovation and discovery in the world of data science._

### Example: Python Code for Animated Live Wallpaper (using `pygame`)

> _**Note:** This is a simplified, stylized representation meant for demonstration. For a more advanced wallpaper, you might use tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (for 3D), [Processing](https://processing.org/), or web-based animations (HTML5 canvas, Three.js)._

```python name=live_wallpaper.py
import pygame
import random
import math

# Initialize PyGame
pygame.init()
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 1280, 720
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("AI Data Science Lab Live Wallpaper")

# Colors
BG_COLOR = (20, 25, 45)
HOLO_BLUE = (90, 230, 255, 120)
HOLO_VIOLET = (200, 140, 255, 100)
WHITE = (230, 230, 250)
YELLOW = (255, 215, 90)
GREEN = (90, 255, 180)
CYAN = (90, 255, 255)

# Particle class for floating data points
class Particle:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = random.randint(0, WIDTH)
        self.y = random.randint(0, HEIGHT)
        self.size = random.randint(1, 4)
        self.speed = random.uniform(0.2, 1.0)
        self.color = random.choice([CYAN, HOLO_VIOLET[:3], GREEN])

    def move(self):
        self.y -= self.speed
        if self.y < 0:
            self.y = HEIGHT
            self.x = random.randint(0, WIDTH)

    surface.blit(s, (x, y))

# Draw a simple "data scientist"

    pygame.draw.line(surface, HOLO_BLUE[:3], (x+10, y+30), (x+35, y+45), 5)
    # Legs
    pygame.draw.line(surface, WHITE, (x-5, y+63), (x-15, y+90), 4)
    pygame.draw.line(surface, WHITE, (x+5, y+63), (x+15, y+90), 4)

> **How to use this as a live wallpaper:**
> - Save the above code as `live_wallpaper.py`
> - Run with `python live_wallpaper.py`
> - Use desktop tools like [Lively Wallpaper](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/) or [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/) to set a Python window as your live wallpaper (requires extra setup).
